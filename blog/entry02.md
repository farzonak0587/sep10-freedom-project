## Engineering Design Process
Since we haven't received a lot of information yet, I would assume that we are still in the early stages of our EDP. After deciding on a topic, all we did was try to identify hardware and software related to it. Since biology is my specialty, I was looking for the various pieces of hardware and software that are used in the field because we would need them for our project. We don't really have time to go over things quickly because our classes on this project are just on Mondays. Due to holidays and other kinds of breaks, we sometimes have Mondays off. Since this project is mostly about research and there are several components to the research for this topic, we are still conducting research and, in my opinion, will continue to do so for some time later on. 

## Skills 
I believe I have learnt a lot more things and developed a lot more talents since writing blog 1. We conducted a lot of research, and I got all of my material from Google, so I think the most crucial skill I gained was **how to use Google to conduct research**. This ability involves more than just searching on Google; I also visited other websites to determine their credibility and whether or not I could trust the information they provided. Now that I know how to do it, I could actually do some research. I've learned a lot more and gotten better at it. We had to locate everything we looked up, so I think that improving my note-taking skills was another skill I acquired from doing research for this project. W had to track down almost everything we found such as what we searched up and the links we went on to find the information we had found. I have been used to taking notes in this way after doing it several times. Note taking also allowed me to become more specific with my ideas.
