# Entry 1: Biology 
##### 10/7/24

## Choosing a topic  
I decided to write on neurology within the field of biology. Growing up, I always wanted to work in the medical field, which is why I chose this topic. I've always wanted to be of help to others, so I needed something that will never fail. That is to say, everyone becomes ill, and you never know what conditions they can run into. For example if you have a tumor, you obviously can't deal with that alone, you will need the help of neurologists or surgeons. My other topics were also in the medical field but they weren't neurology. My other topics were dentistry and being a pediatrician. Many articles such as [Technology - College of Dental Medicine](https://www.dental.columbia.edu/research/research-centers/center-precision-dental-medicine/technology) and [The Expansion of Pediatric Care Through Digital Technology](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8487230/)
