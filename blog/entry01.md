# Entry 1: Biology

## Choosing a topic  
I decided to write on neurology within the field of biology. Growing up, I always wanted to work in the medical field, which is why I chose this topic. I've always wanted to be of help to others, so I needed something that will never fail. That is to say, everyone becomes ill, and you never know what conditions theyÂ can run into. For example if you have a tumor, you obviously can't deal with that alone, you will need the help of neurologists or surgeons.
