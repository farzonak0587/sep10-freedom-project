## Choosing a topic  
I decided to write on neurology within the field of biology. Growing up, I always wanted to work in the medical field, which is why I chose this topic. My parents were quite happy that I decided to go into the medical field because both my parents have worked there. I've always wanted to be of help to others, so I needed something that will never fail. That is to say, everyone becomes ill, and you never know what conditions they can run into. For example, if you have a tumor, you obviously can't deal with that alone; you will need the help of neurologists or surgeons. My other topics were also in the medical field, but they weren't neurology. My other topics were dentistry and being a pediatrician.Â Many articles such as [Technology - College of Dental Medicine](https://www.dental.columbia.edu/research/research-centers/center-precision-dental-medicine/technology) and [The Expansion of Pediatric Care Through Digital Technology](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8487230/),but unfortunately, I had been thinking about being a surgeon for much too long, so I wasn't all that interested in these subjects.

The websites that really got me interested were [Future of Neurology & Technology](https://www.neurology.org/doi/10.1212/WNL.0000000000012413) and [Neurologists and Technology](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5765950/) They were the ones that drew my interest with their explanations of how technology has benefited patients and neurologists alike and how it might be used to enhance neurology teaching.
