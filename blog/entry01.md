## Choosing a topic  
I decided to write on neurology within the field of biology. Growing up, I always wanted to work in the medical field, which is why I chose this topic. My parents were quite happy that I decided to go into the medical field because both my parents have worked there. I've always wanted to be of help to others, so I needed something that will never fail. That is to say, everyone becomes ill, and you never know what conditions they can run into. For example, if you have a tumor, you obviously can't deal with that alone; you will need the help of neurologists or surgeons. My other topics were also in the medical field, but they weren't neurology. My other topics were dentistry and being a pediatrician. Many articles such as [Technology - College of Dental Medicine](https://www.dental.columbia.edu/research/research-centers/center-precision-dental-medicine/technology) and [The Expansion of Pediatric Care Through Digital Technology](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8487230/),but unfortunately, I had been thinking about being a surgeon for much too long, so I wasn't all that interested in these subjects.

The websites that really got me interested were [Future of Neurology & Technology](https://www.neurology.org/doi/10.1212/WNL.0000000000012413) and [Neurologists and Technology](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5765950/) They were the ones that drew my interest with their explanations of how technology has benefited patients and neurologists alike and how it might be used to enhance neurology teaching.

## Engineering Design Process
This project has only recently begun, and my entire class and I haven't really gotten into it yet. The engineering design process is still in its first phases. At this point, all we have done is choose the subject of our interest and conduct some basic research on it. It is likely that at this point we will begin the actual research for our project. We have begun exploring into the various categories of technology related to the issue we selected.  
## Skills 
Among my many talents is my extreme **organization**; for instance, I keep track of everything I need to do and get really stressed out when I forget. This also has to do with **time management** because I enjoy making good use of my time. I'm very punctual and enjoy meeting deadlines. When I get disorganized and lose track, I also have trouble keeping track of time because it confuses me until I figure it out.My ability to **communicate** is another skill I have. If I'm having trouble with something or need clarification, I can always ask my friends or classmates. I feel safe asking those kinds of questions since I have had enough conversations with them. I know if I don't ask now, I will 100% feels confused in class and not know what to do.
