# Entry 4: Choosing a Tool to Learn

## Content
For our Freedom Project, we had to explore new web design tools that we could eventually learn and use in our projects. The first step was to browse through a bunch of tools and pick our top three favorites. After checking out a few options, I picked:

### Tools Explored

I tried learnig all the basics with mostly [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/css) but I also did use some other types of websites that our teacher provided us. 

- **CSS Variables** – I thought CSS Variables would be awesome because they let you store values like colors and fonts and reuse them across your stylesheet. I figured it would save a lot of time, but when I started using it, I realized it was super easy and didn't feel like much of a challenge at all. It just made things cleaner, but I was hoping for something more complicated.

- **Wow.js** – Wow.js seemed like a fun tool because it lets you add cool animations when things scroll into view. I thought it would make my website look really cool, but it was a bit harder to get the hang of. There were a lot of settings to play around with, and making sure everything worked right on different devices took a bit more effort than I expected.

- **Flexbox** – I picked Flexbox because it looked like it would help a lot with making layouts responsive. It was somewhere in the middle for me— not too easy but not as hard as Wow.js. I started trying it through [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css3_flexbox.asp) and a bit of [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/responsive-web-design/#responsive-web-design-principles), and it was a good way to get the basics, but I knew there was more to it than just what was on the site.

#### What I Tried/Changed/Created with Flexbox:

1. **Basic Flexbox Setup:**
   I started with the basics—just putting a few items in a container and using `display: flex` to turn it into a Flexbox. Then I played around with properties like `justify-content` and `align-items` to see how they spaced out the items. For example, I tried `justify-content: space-between` to spread them out across the container, and `align-items: center` to make everything line up in the middle.

2. **Changing Flex Direction:**
   One of the first things I tried was changing the `flex-direction` property. By default, Flexbox arranges items in a row, but I switched it to `column` to stack the items vertically. This was pretty cool because it showed me how Flexbox can switch layouts depending on the space available.

3. **Playing with Flex Items:**
   I didn’t go super deep, but I played with `flex-grow` and `flex-shrink` on the items to make them change size depending on the container. I set `flex-grow: 1` on one of the items, and it made it take up the extra space, which was awesome to see in action.

4. **Basic Responsive Layout:**
   I also tried making a simple responsive layout. Using media queries, I made the `flex-direction` switch from a row to a column when the screen was smaller. It wasn’t perfect, but it was cool to see the layout change when I resized the browser.

#### How I Learned:
The tutorials on [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css3_flexbox.asp) were really helpful because they have these interactive examples where you can try out different Flexbox properties and see how they work right there on the page. They also have quizzes that let you test what you’ve learned, which was nice to practice some more. I spent most of my time there because I was just messing around and trying to understand the basics, not really learning everything in depth.

I also checked out a few lessons on [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/responsive-web-design/#responsive-web-design-principles). They have full lessons that explain Flexbox step by step, but I didn’t go super deep into it yet. I just did a couple of lessons to get an idea of how it works, but W3Schools was the main place I used since I was just tinkering and not fully diving into it.

## Skills 
While working on this project, I’ve learned a lot of new skills that have helped me get better at web design. One of the biggest things I’ve gotten better at is **choosing the right tools**. At first, I had to look through a bunch of options and figure out which ones would work best for me. I ended up picking tools like CSS Variables, Wow.js, and Flexbox. This helped me get better at deciding what would work for what I needed and what was best for where I was in my learning.

**Tinkering and experimenting** with the tools has also been a big skill I’ve worked on. When I chose Flexbox, I wasn’t totally sure what I was doing, but I just played around with the settings and saw how changing things affected the layout. It took a lot of trial and error, but that’s how I learned the basics. It wasn’t too hard, but it definitely wasn’t the easiest thing ever either, so it was a good middle ground for me to practice with.

I also got better at using **interactive resources**. I spent a lot of time on sites like W3Schools where I could mess with the code live, and FreeCodeCamp had some lessons that helped me understand how to use Flexbox in real projects. Using these sites really helped me learn by doing, and I liked that I could go at my own pace.

Overall, I’ve definitely gotten more confident with web design. Choosing the right tools, experimenting with them, and learning through resources has made me a lot better, and these skills will definitely help me with future projects!
