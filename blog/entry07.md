# Content

### Context 
For our Freedom Project, we had to do two different presentations to show off what we created and what we learned. The first one was the **Expo elevator pitch**, which was a super short and fast-paced presentation — only about a minute long. We had to present to judges in the cafeteria while lots of other students were doing the same. The judges were looking for projects that stood out, and they were the ones who decided if you could become a finalist and move on to the next round. If you were picked as a finalist, you'd get to present again, but this time in the auditorium in front of the SEP students and a few teachers, which was a pretty big deal.

The second presentation was our **in-class presentation**, which was more detailed and a lot longer. We had to make a Google Slides deck and present it to the whole class for about 3 to 10 minutes. This one had to include a strong hook at the beginning to grab everyone’s attention, the challenges we faced while creating our Freedom Project, our final product, and the takeaways we had from the experience. It was definitely more nerve-wracking since everyone in class was watching, but it gave us a chance to reflect on how far we’d come and everything we learned along the way.

# Challenges and Takeaways


###  Elevator Pitch Challenges

- **What was hard:**  
I didn’t know what to include in just one minute because I felt like everything on my website was important.

  - **How I handled it:**  
    I asked myself, “What’s the main purpose of my website?” and picked 2–3 major features to talk about. I practiced cutting down long explanations into aa minute explanation.

  - **What I learned:**  
I developed the skill of **summarizing and focusing** on the core message of my project. I realized that in real life, people often don’t have time to hear every single detail — so getting straight to the point is super useful.

---

- **What was hard:**  
I didn’t really have time to memorize my pitch because I was more focused on preparing for my class presentation.

  - **How I handled it:**  
I wrote down a few key points instead of a full script and practiced saying them in different ways. I also reminded myself that it was okay if I didn’t sound perfect.

  - **What I learned:**  
    I gained more **confidence speaking naturally** and learned that you don’t always need to memorize every word — just knowing your main ideas is enough if you practice saying them out loud.

---

- **What was hard:**  
It was scary presenting to judges I didn’t know, and when I finished, they didn’t say anything — they just walked away. That made me feel like I did something wrong.

  - **How I handled it:**  
I reminded myself that the judges had to move quickly and probably didn’t have time to give feedback to every student. I talked to classmates afterward and found out a lot of them had the same experience.

  - **What I learned:**  
   I learned to **trust myself** and not depend on people’s reactions to know if I did well. Just finishing the pitch and staying calm under pressure was already a big accomplishment.

##  In-Class Presentation Challenges

- **What was hard:**  
I kept saying words like “um” and “like” because I was nervous and had never presented by myself in front of the whole class.

  - **How I handled it:**  
   After noticing this during my practice run, I started recording myself and listening back to catch when I said filler words. I also practiced pausing when I needed to think instead of filling the silence with “um.” But that didn't really help me and I still kept using filler words during my actual presentation. 

  - **What I learned:**  
   I became more **self-aware of how I speak**, and learned that it’s okay to pause — it actually makes you sound more confident and in control.

---

- **What was hard:**  
 I avoided eye contact because looking at people made me even more nervous, and I was afraid I’d forget what to say.

  - **How I handled it:**  
During the presentaiton I was looking at the back wall to simulate eye contact without freaking out. I also kept looking at one personn instead of the whole class. 

  - **What I learned:**  
    I learned that making some eye contact (even fake eye contact) helps people stay engaged, and that facing your fear even a little bit helps you improve for next time.
    
---

- **What was hard:**  
  My mind went completely blank 2–3 times during my presentation, and I had to figure out what to say on the spot.

  - **How I handled it:**  
     I paused, took a breath, and looked at my slides to help jog my memory. I had backup notes just in case, so I quickly glanced at them.

  - **What I learned:**  
     I learned how to **think on my feet and recover** when things don’t go perfectly. Everyone blanks out sometimes — it’s how you handle it that matters.

---

- **What was hard:**  
  I made my slides on Canva, but had to transfer everything to Google Slides.

  - **How I handled it:**  
    I looked up how to move content over, and even though it took time, I adjusted each slide one by one.

  - **What I learned:**  
    Being flexible with tools and problem-solving is key — it also helped me improve my tech skills.


## Engineering Design Process

I have completed all the work on my website, including designing, building, and applying Flexbox to make it responsive. I have also presented my project both to my classmates and to the judges during the expo. Now, I am at the "Communicate the Results" stage, where I share what I accomplished and reflect on the overall process. At this point, I am looking back at parts that didn’t go exactly as planned, such as struggling with responsiveness and managing my nerves during presentations. I am thinking about what challenges I faced, how I overcame them, and what I could do differently next time to improve both my project and my presentation skills. This reflection will help me grow as a designer and prepare me for future projects.


## Skills

- I learned how to **present with more confidence**, even when I was nervous or things didn’t go perfectly. Presenting to judges and classmates pushed me out of my comfort zone, but now I feel more prepared to speak in front of people in the future.

- I practiced **clear communication, time management, and how to summarize my work under pressure**. Cutting down a whole project into a 1-minute pitch really taught me how to be brief but still make an impact.

- I discovered that being **flexible, staying calm, and not giving up when things go wrong** are skills that go beyond just school projects — they’re life skills. Transferring between platforms, handling tech issues, and recovering when I blanked during my speech taught me how to adapt and keep going.

- I learned how to **think on the spot and problem-solve fast**. When I forgot parts of my script or had tech difficulties, I didn’t panic — I figured it out in the moment, which made me trust myself more.

- I improved my **digital design and tech skills** by building my website, switching between tools like Canva and Google Slides, and fixing bugs with Flexbox. These skills made me more confident in using creative and coding tools.

- I got better at **independent learning**, since I taught myself how to use Flexbox and applied it to my website without step-by-step instructions. It showed me that I’m capable of figuring things out on my own.

- I practiced **self-reflection and personal growth**, especially through writing about my challenges and takeaways. It helped me realize how much progress I actually made, even if things didn’t always go smoothly.

- I learned the value of **asking for help and using feedback**. Talking to classmates and teachers to improve my site made a huge difference, and I saw how collaborating with others makes my work better.
