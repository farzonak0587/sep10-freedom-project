## Content
Since Blog 1 and 2, I’ve been refining my understanding of how technology intersects with biology, which led me to brainstorm futuristic innovations. To come up with these ideas, I focused on the challenges and opportunities in modern biology and healthcare. I wanted to explore technologies that could drastically change how we approach medicine, disease prevention, and human enhancement in the future.

### Brainstorming Process:
My brainstorming involved several key strategies:

#### Identifying Areas for Improvement:
I thought about current medical challenges, like the limitations in treating genetic diseases, the need for more personalized healthcare, and how new technologies could push the boundaries of diagnostics and treatments.

#### Researching Emerging Technologies:
I dove into fields like nanotechnology, bioengineering, and AI. By looking at the latest advancements, I imagined how these technologies could evolve to make a huge impact on biology in the future.

#### Exploring Biological Processes:
I considered natural processes like DNA replication and cell repair, brainstorming ways technology could enhance or mimic these biological systems to help with healing and disease prevention.

#### Considering Real-World Applications:
I thought about how these futuristic innovations could fill gaps in healthcare or improve quality of life, whether through new treatments or better monitoring and prevention.

This approach helped me explore ideas like nanobot-driven DNA repair, organ-on-a-chip systems, health-monitoring tattoos, and memory-enhancing brain devices, blending my knowledge of biology with creative thinking to imagine how technology could transform human health.

### Finalizing All Content for the Website:
After generating these ideas, I focused on making sure the content was organized, easy to understand, and visually appealing for the website. Here’s how I went about finalizing everything:

#### Organizing the Information:
I broke down the content into two main sections: Software and Hardware in Biology. Each item had a brief description, making it easy to skim and understand what each app or hardware does. This organization helped users find what they’re looking for without confusion.

#### Adding Links and Sources:
To make the content more informative, I added links to each app and piece of hardware, with a "More info here" section or images that show what each device looks like. I double-checked these links to ensure they were accurate and directed to the right sources.

#### Simplifying the Language:
Since biology can get pretty complicated, I made sure to keep the language simple and clear. I aimed to make the content easy for anyone to understand, whether they have a background in biology or not. I avoided over-explaining concepts and used easy-to-follow descriptions.

#### Adding Cool Future Ideas:
The “Future Innovations in Biology” section was particularly fun to write. I highlighted futuristic concepts like nanobots repairing DNA or smart tattoos tracking health, explaining how these innovations could work in the future and why they’re so exciting.

#### Double-Checking Everything:
Once everything was written, I went back to review and revise the content. I looked for any mistakes or confusing parts and made sure the information flowed logically from one section to the next. I also checked that the content was accurate and clear, which is important for making the website easy to understand and navigate.




## Engineering Design Process
Since we haven't received a lot of information yet, I would assume that we are still in the early stages of our EDP. After deciding on a topic, all we did was try to identify hardware and software related to it. Since biology is my specialty, I was looking for the various pieces of hardware and software that are used in the field because we would need them for our project. We don't really have time to go over things quickly because our classes on this project are just on Mondays. Due to holidays and other kinds of breaks, we sometimes have Mondays off. Since this project is mostly about research and there are several components to the research for this topic, we are still conducting research and, in my opinion, will continue to do so for some time later on. 

## Skills 
I believe I have learnt a lot more things and developed a lot more talents since writing blog 1. We conducted a lot of research, and I got all of my material from Google, so I think the most crucial skill I gained was **how to use Google to conduct research**. This ability involves more than just searching on Google; I also visited other websites to determine their credibility and whether or not I could trust the information they provided. Now that I know how to do it, I could actually do some research. I've learned a lot more and gotten better at it. We had to locate everything we looked up, so I think that improving my **note-taking** skills was another skill I acquired from doing research for this project. W had to track down almost everything we found such as what we searched up and the links we went on to find the information we had found. I have been used to taking notes in this way after doing it several times. Note taking also allowed me to become more specific with my ideas.
