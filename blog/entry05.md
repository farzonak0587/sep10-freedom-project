###  What I Learned

Over the past few weeks, I‚Äôve been learning all about **Flexbox**, and honestly, it‚Äôs been really cool seeing how much easier it makes web design. At first, I didn‚Äôt really get what it was for, but now I understand that Flexbox helps you control how things are laid out on a webpage‚Äîespecially when the screen size changes.

Here are some of the main things I learned:

- `display: flex;` changes how elements are arranged‚Äîwithout it, everything just stacks.
- `flex-direction` lets you switch between rows and columns.
- `justify-content` and `align-items` help space out stuff on the main and cross axis.
- `flex-wrap` lets items wrap to a new row if they don‚Äôt fit.
- `flex-grow`, `flex-shrink`, and `flex-basis` control how items change size.
- You can even change the order of items using the `order` property.
- And finally, `gap` is a super simple way to add space between items without using margins.

### How I Learned

I used a bunch of websites to help me figure it out:

- [W3Schools - Flexbox Guide](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css3_flexbox.asp)
- [MDN Web Docs - Flexbox](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/flex)
- [CSS-Tricks: A Complete Guide to Flexbox](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/)
- YouTube: Searched things like ‚ÄúFlexbox in 5 minutes‚Äù and watched short, focused videos

I also wrote down notes and tried out the properties in live code editors like CodePen.

### What I Tried / Changed / Made
I didn‚Äôt just read or watch stuff‚ÄîI actually tried things out too! Here are some examples:

üîπ Basic Flexbox Layout
I made a simple box layout with 3 items in a row using:


``` css 
.container {
  display: flex;
  justify-content: space-between;
  align-items: center;
}
```

Before Flexbox, everything was stacked. After I added display: flex, the items lined up in a row and spaced out perfectly.

üîπ **Switching Directions**

Then I tried flex-direction: column, and it stacked the items vertically instead. Super easy to change the whole layout with just one line.

üîπ **Wrapping Items**

I made a box of 8 items and used flex-wrap: wrap; to make it look better on smaller screens. Without it, everything just squished together.

üîπ **Grow and Shrink**

I tested flex-grow: 1 on one item and flex-grow: 2 on another, and I could actually see how the second one grew more than the first when there was extra space.

üîπ**Order and Align Self**

I also changed the order of items using the order property, which was kinda fun. And I used align-self: flex-end on one item to move it to the bottom by itself.

**Screenshots + Examples:**

**Without** `display: flex;`

**Another Example of flex-direction:**
``` css 
.parent {
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: column;
}
```

### Challenges Faced While Learning Flexbox

- **Wrapping Items Was Confusing at First:**  
  Initially, I didn‚Äôt understand how `flex-wrap` worked. I thought it would always wrap items to the next line, but it only does that when the container is too small to fit everything in a single line. It took me a while to figure out how to control the wrapping behavior.

- **Aligning Items on Different Axes:**  
  Understanding how `justify-content` and `align-items` worked together was tricky. I kept mixing up the main axis and the cross axis, so sometimes things weren‚Äôt aligning the way I thought they would. It took practice to get the hang of how to align items on both axes.

## Skills 
By working with Flexbox, I‚Äôve really leveled up in a few key areas:

- **Self-Learning:** Since I was learning Flexbox by myself, I got pretty good at figuring things out on my own. I didn‚Äôt have a teacher or anyone guiding me, so I had to rely on online resources like W3Schools and YouTube. I‚Äôd just experiment with different code until it made sense.

- **Problem Solving:** Flexbox is a bit tricky sometimes, especially when things don‚Äôt look right. I learned how to troubleshoot by checking different sources when something wasn‚Äôt working. I‚Äôd try something new, see how it worked, and figure out what went wrong‚Äîkind of like solving a puzzle.

- **Experimenting with Code:** A big part of learning Flexbox was just messing around with it. I‚Äôd try out different properties, change values, and see how it affected the layout. It was fun because I didn‚Äôt always know what would happen, but that‚Äôs how I learned the most.
