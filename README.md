# SEP10 Freedom Project
by **Farzona Khabibova**

## Context
I am a student at [HSTAT](https://www.hstat.org/) in the [Software Engineering Program](https://hstatsep.github.io/). The "Freedom Project" for SEP10 is a year-long project all about making a website that informs the viewer of the current and future innovations in the topic of my choosing.

For my project, I chose the topic of **Biology**. 

I used HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and Github. I also chose to independently study **Flexbox** in order to help me make my website.

## Implications
##### PROS
* It was actually really fun because I got to pick my own topic.
* I had full control over how I wanted my website to look and feel.
* I taught myself Flexbox and actually got to use it in my project.
* I gained a bunch of skills, like learning how to communicate with others for feedback and being more independent since we did this project on our own.
* It helped me get better at problem-solving. Every time a code didnt work , I had to figure out how to fix it on my own.
* I became more confident using HTML and CSS, especially when it came to organizing the structure of my website.
* It was a creative way to show what I learned, not just by writing but actually building something.
* Seeing the final result after all the hard work was super satisfying.
  
##### CONS
* It took a lot of time and effort. Sometimes I’d spend hours on something small.
* I ran into tons of little bugs that stressed me out and were hard to fix.
* I had a hard time making the website look good on both phones and computers (responsiveness was a struggle).
* I got stuck a few times and didn’t always know where to get help.
* There were moments where I felt overwhelmed, especially when deadlines were coming up.
* I was super nervous and stressed about the presentations, especially talking in front of people
